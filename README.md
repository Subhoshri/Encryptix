# Encryptix Internship Projects

Welcome to the Encryptix Internship Projects repository! This repository contains three machine-learning projects that I developed during my internship. These projects utilize Pyplot, Matplotlib, and Seaborn Libraries for data visualization and various machine-learning models. The projects included are:

1. Churn Prediction
2. Credit Card Fraud Detection
3. Movie Genre Classification

Each project is organized in its own directory and contains the necessary data, and resources to understand and run the models. Below, you will find an overview of each project along with instructions on how to set up and run them.

## Churn Prediction

### Overview

Customer churn prediction aims to identify customers who are likely to leave a service. This project uses machine learning to predict churn based on customer data of a particular bank and predicts the churn rate.

### Contents

- `churn_prediction`
  - `dataset`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
  - `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
  - `results`: Contains the results of model evaluations and visualizations.
  

## Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Overview

Credit card fraud detection aims to identify fraudulent transactions. This project uses machine learning models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

### Contents

- `credit_card_fraud_detection`
  - `dataset`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
  - `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
  - `results`: Contains the results of model evaluations and visualizations.


## Movie Genre Classification

### Overview

Movie genre classification aims to predict the genre of a movie based on its attributes. This project uses machine learning to classify movies into genres.

### Contents

- `movie_genre_classification`
  - `dataset`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
  - `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
  - `results`: Contains the results of model evaluations and visualizations.

## Installation

To run these projects, you'll need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file provided in each project directory.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Encryptix.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

After setting up the environment and installing the necessary dependencies, you can run the scripts as described in each project's section. Use Jupyter notebooks for an interactive exploration of the data and models.
